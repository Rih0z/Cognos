### 5. Integration Validation Push
**Target**: boss
**Phases**:
- **Phase 1**: Technical integration checks between all researchers
- **Phase 2**: Performance integration with cross-constraints
- **Phase 3**: Implementation readiness verification checklists

### 6. Performance Metrics Demand
**Target**: ai-researcher
**Measurable targets required**:
- Response times (prompt→code generation in milliseconds)
- Throughput (concurrent code generation requests)
- Memory efficiency (MB per 1K tokens)
- Error rates (hallucination detection precision)
- Battery consumption (per inference on mobile)

### 7. Working Code Samples Request
**Target**: lang-researcher
**Required implementations**:
- Functional lexer/parser for basic Cognos syntax
- Type inference engine with working type checking
- AI integration prototype (prompt→code generation)
- System call integration matching OS specifications
- Performance tests with compilation time and memory profiling

### 8. Kernel Prototype Demand

**Required deliverables**:
- QEMU-bootable kernel (`qemu-system-x86_64`)
- Physical/virtual memory management implementation
- Five complete system calls implemented
- AI-dedicated memory allocator for SLM models
- Performance measurements (boot time, memory usage, system call execution time)

### 9. Competitive Validation Process
**Target**: boss
**Timeline**:
- **24h**: Cross-researcher specification reviews and integration problem identification
- **48h**: Integration testing under combined constraints
- **72h**: Implementation competition for first working prototype
- **96h**: Final integrated Cognos system with performance benchmarks

### 10. Final Ultimatum to AI Researcher
**Production-ready requirements**:

- Real benchmark results (measured inference time, memory, accuracy)
- C/Rust FFI-compatible integration APIs
- Automated test cases with input/output examples
- Complete deployment procedures

## Expected Outcomes

### Technical Precision
- No abstract concepts - only concrete implementations
- Exact data structures, algorithms, protocols defined
- Performance numbers, memory layouts, API signatures specified
- Measurable targets rather than qualitative descriptions

### Cross-Researcher Integration
- Each researcher validates others' specs for compatibility
- Integration points and dependencies clearly identified
- Unified architecture diagrams created
- Real-time collaborative problem solving

### Implementation Readiness Test
- Specifications detailed enough for immediate coding
- All dependencies and interfaces clearly defined
- Performance targets are measurable and achievable
- Working prototypes demonstrating feasibility

## Success Criteria
- Developer can start coding tomorrow from provided specifications
- All cross-researcher dependencies are resolved
- Performance benchmarks are concrete and measurable
- Working code samples validate theoretical designs
- Integrated system prototype demonstrates end-to-end functionality

## Session Status
**ACTIVE** - Messages sent to initiate intensive collaborative specification development. Awaiting detailed technical responses from all researchers.
